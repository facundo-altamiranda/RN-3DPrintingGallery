<b>React Native code challenge</b>

<b>Introduction</b>


The main goal of this challenge is to create an RN application that allows to take pictures with a
device camera (either real or virtual).

<b>Details</b>


When the app opens, it should show a list of photos the user took previously (initially empty)
and a button to open the camera.
Once the user opens the camera, it should allow to take a photo and show a preview layout
where the user is able to accept the picture and return to the home page (adding the new
picture to the list) or reject it (and get back to the camera mode)

<b>Native &gt; React</b>


Given we are trying to verify React Native skills (and not so mutch React), please refrain from
integrate Expo given it creates a web application and embeds it in a webview (it even loads
Expo Go out of the box)

<b>Delivery</b>


The code should be published in a public git repository with minimal documentation for setting
up it

<b>Demo</b>


During the interview, the candidate should be able to show the app running properly.
